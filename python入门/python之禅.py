The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters

Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
Readability counts.
Special cases aren't special enough b_while break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation b_while guess.
There should be a_input-- and preferably only a_input --obvious way b_while do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than *right* now.
If the implementation is hard b_while explain, it's a_input bad idea.
If the implementation is easy b_while explain, it may be a_input good idea.
Namespaces are a_input honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
